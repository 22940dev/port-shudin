# COVID-19, BTC, and M1

These are the 3 things in 2020 that tremendously changed the way I think about life, the world and the tools I use everyday.

**COVID-19** changed everyone's life. I was in Wuhan, the center of the pandemic, back in January. 
And suddenly I got lost in the flood of information.

After many sleepless nights I made it clear to myself, about what I should spend more time with in my life. Things I enjoy, people I love, and most importantly: myself.

The obsession with information and connection just doesn't make us happier. I started to delete unnecessary apps as many as possible. Actually as a human being, no app _should_ be necessary to my life. I started to write down my dreams, I started to work on creative artworks with code. I also finished about 10 books in 2020, and most of them are poem collections.

**BTC** doubled its highest historical price very quickly. I knew BTC in 2013 and did my first crypto investment in 2017, but I never took it seriously and got a conclusion about what it actually is, until 2020. Of course, I have to admit that the price got my attention to think again about that question. 

But _value_ is not _price_.

**Apple M1** is a new laptop chip shipped by Apple in 2020.
